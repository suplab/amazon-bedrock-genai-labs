# AWS Generative AI and AI Agents with Amazon Bedrock

This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks focused on building generative AI applications and AI agents using **Amazon Bedrock**.  
The content is implementation-driven and oriented toward enterprise-grade use cases.

---

## Overview

Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that provides access to foundation models from leading AI providers through a unified API. It eliminates the need to manage infrastructure for model hosting and scaling, allowing teams to focus on application design, orchestration, and integration.

This repository demonstrates how to use Amazon Bedrock to build generative AI systems that are scalable, secure, and production-oriented.

All examples are delivered as Jupyter notebooks to support experimentation, inspection, and reproducibility.
